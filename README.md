## Psychological Foundation

### Integrated Approaches

- **Projection Method** - Using symbols as mirrors to externalize the unconscious
  - Uses Tarot and I Ching as projection surfaces (same principle as Rorschach tests)
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** - Recognizing and restructuring thought patterns
  - Identifying cognitive distortions and developing balanced perspectives
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** - Balancing emotion and reason
  - Teaching practical emotion regulation skills
- **Mindfulness** - Bringing awareness to the present moment
  - Cultivating present-moment awareness and accepting attitude
- **Narrative Therapy** - Rewriting life stories
  - Creating meaning through storytelling and re-authoring experiences

### Why Fortune-telling?

Fortune-telling is humanity's oldest decision-support system. Through symbolic thinking:
- Access insights unreachable by logical thinking alone
- Bring unconscious patterns to consciousness
- Create meaning through narrative
- Utilize cultural wisdom accumulated over millennia

## Practical Applications

### Dependency Prevention Tips

To maintain a healthy relationship with divination:
- Regularly practice "intuition-only days" without drawing cards
- Make decisions without divination 1-2 times per month
- Track divination results vs. actual outcomes to observe your intuitive growth
- Always remember: "Divination is one reference among many"

### Localization Examples

When using the Earth voice (spatial harmony), incorporate your local environment:

- **Lakeside regions**: "The wind from the lake speaks of coming changes..."
- **Coastal areas**: "The tide's rhythm reveals optimal timing..."
- **Mountain regions**: "Mountain energy teaches stability..."
- **Urban areas**: "The city's pulse indicates activity cycles..."

## Ethical Considerations
